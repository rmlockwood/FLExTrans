Copy one of the modules and rename it

Edit the module to correspond to the folder name of the new project

Run the "RunTestbed" FlexTools project and edit the collection to add the new project

Run the new module which starts the new project

Copy "CopyTestResults.py" from another testbed project to the new project's FlexTools\Modules folder

Edit the collection and delete the "Insert Target Text" module and add the "Copy Test Results" module

Run the new project to make sure it is working

Create a new folder in the GoldStandard folder named the same as the project folder
