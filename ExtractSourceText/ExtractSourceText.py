#
#   Dump an interlinear text into Apertium format so that it can be
#   used by the Apertium transfer engine.
#
#   Version 1.3.1 - 4/15/16 - Ron
#    No changes to this module.
#
#   Version 1.2.1 - 2/11/16 - Ron
#    Error checking when opening the analyzed text file.
#
#   Version 1.2.0 - 1/28/16 - Ron
#    Punctuation support. Allow the user to specify the punctuation that 
#    indicates the end of a sentence. This punctuation will get marked
#    with the tag <sent>. The user specifies it in the configuration file.
#    Compound word support. Change one lexical unit containing multiple words
#    to multiple lexical units, one for each word. For example: 
#    ^room1.1<n>service1.1<n>number1.1<n>$ ->
#    ^room1.1<n>$^service1.1<n>$^number1.1<n>$ 
#
#   Version 4 - 7/24/15 - Ron
#    Preserve case in words. 
#    Do capitalization of the extracted word. Use the baseline word as a model
#    for how to capitalize it. For the complex form case, save the 1st base-
#    line word for a model of the whole complex form. Removed large commented
#    section of code that was for checking if the whole text had been analyzed.
#
#   Version 3 - 7/16/15 - Ron
#    Handle irregularly inflected forms. Do this by collecting inflection 
#    features when moving through variants to get to a main entry. Output those
#    saved inflection features as tags. 
#    Handle morphology on initial component(s) of complex forms. Save any tags
#    that are present on the initial component(s) and add them to the complex
#    form as morphology.
#
#   Version 2 - 7/4/15 - Ron
#    Dump a possible inflection class present for the root/stem.
#    Changed module description.

u"""
The source database should be chosen for this module. This module will first check 
to see if each word in the selected text is
fully analyzed (word gloss or category is not necessary). If the text is not
fully analyzed an error will be generated.
Next, this module will go through each bundle in the interlinear text and export
information in the format that Apertium needs. The general idea is that
affixes and clitics will be exported as <gloss> and root/stems will be exported
as head_word<pos><feat1>...<featN><class>. Where feat1 to featN are one or more 
inflection features that may be present for the root/stem 
and class is an inflection class that may be present on the stem.
This Module assumes the file FlexTrans.config is in the FlexTools folder.
