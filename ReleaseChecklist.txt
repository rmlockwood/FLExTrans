Do these things when making a new release (when a beta release is not already set up)
=====================================================================================
-Update module version #s to X.X if they are lower. E.g. bring everything up to 3.6 that was 3.5.x
-Finish code changes and commit
-Edit createInstallFolder2.0.bat and set FLEXTRANS_VERSION at the top to the new version #.
-Edit FLExTrans-installer.nsi setting PRODUCT_VERSION to the new version #.
-Also change VIProductVersion in the .nsi file  to the new version #. This has to always have the 3rd # so make it 0 if needed. E.g. 3.12.0.${BUILD_NUM}
-Change Copyright date if necessary in the .nsi file.
