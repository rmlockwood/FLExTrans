Do these things when making a new release
-Update module version #s to X.X if they are lower. E.g. bring everything up to 3.6 that was 3.5.x
-Finish code changes and commit
-Edit createInstallFolder2.0.bat and set FLEXTRANS_VERSION at the top to the new version #.
-Edit FLExTrans-installer.nsi setting PRODUCT_VERSION to the new version #.
-Also change VIProductVersion in the .nsi file  to the new version #. This has to always have the 3rd # so make it 0 if needed. E.g. 3.12.0.${BUILD_NUM}
-Change Copyright date if necessary in the .nsi file. 
-Edit Version.py in the FlexTools folder with the new version #s (Also for FLExTools) (this shows up in the title bar and About)
-Change TeamCity by editing the FLExTrans project, Build FLExTrans Installer configuration, Artifact paths to use the new version #
-Build and test the install locally
-Do another commit that has the install changes
-Finish merging all pull requests
-Get FLExTransX.X.exe from the software.sil.org products folder and put in the local Installer folder
-Download zip files from TeamCity and put into git folders (main FT folder and Previous Versions)
-Test the install
-Make a new .download_info file changing the relevant data. 3 changes.
-Upload the new .download_info file using FileZilla to the uploads_areas\flextrans folder (see SSH key ... in keepass for password)
-Create the release in Git with the new version string. 
 -Go to tags, switch to Releases
 -Click draft new release
 -Choose a tag (dropdown) and give new vx.x.x and click Create new tag xxx on publish
 -Fill out Title (e.g. 3.7 - Sense Linker and Live Rule Tester Improvements)

 -Edit release notes.
-Make a new post on software.sil.org/flextrans. (use same bullets as the Github release page)
-Update the instructions on the download and installation web pages as necessary.
