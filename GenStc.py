    # When we are getting these from the lexicon, we need to bring in not only the lemma, but also

    # An example of fetching features is in the funtion getInflectionInfoSymbols in ExtractBilingualLexicon.py

    # include, e.g., adj, AdjMF?  
    # But for now, if they want more than one POS, they need to make another sentence for it.
 ## Temporarily hardcoding these lists

    # In order to apply the rules correctly to do agreement; we need to include all the features from 
    # these lexical entries.  In the hard-coded version, I haven't included those, so anything masculine
    # in a sentence that expects feminine, comes out as "not found" (@caramelo1.1) currently.

### This was more code from ExtractText.py, from after the text was processed.
###  But I'm writing out one sentence at a time, not the whole text at a time, so I don't think I need this.
###  It would probably be nice to do some reporting though.
###  I'm just using the close part for now.        
#------------------From ExtractText.py--------------------------------

#    if 1:
#        # Write out all the words in Apertium format
#        myText.write(f_out)
#        
#        report.Info("Exported: " + str(myText.getSentCount()) + " sentence(s).")
        
    f_out.close()

    report.Info("Export of " + sourceTextName + " complete.")
    

###  This is how other modules run their process and generate error messages.
###  I don't have this part working yet.    
 ###-----------Run the process?
