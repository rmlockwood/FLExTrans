#   Version 1.1.5 - 1/10/18 - Ron Lockwood
#    Put run_makefile in this file so that both RunApertium and LiveRuleTesterTool
#    can use it. Put split_compounds in this file so that ExtractSourceText and 
#    LiveRuleTesterTool can use it.
#
#   Version 1.1.4 - 1/1/18 - Ron
#    Put process_lexical_unit and associated functions in this file so that
#    both ViewSrcTgt and LiveRuleTesterTool can use it.
#
#   Version 1.1.3 - 12/26/17 - Ron
#    Suppress warnings for standard format markers (e.g. \s) and some special
#    Combinations of a sfm and following text. Also suppress warnings when the
#    same unknown word occurs more than once, but give a warning that an
#    unknown word occurred multiple times.
#
#   Version 1.1.2 - 1/18/17 - Ron
#    Scripture text fixes. Surface forms had empty lines. Prevented this.
#    Changed some comments.
#
#   Version 1.1.1 - 11/9/16 - Ron
#    Handle any kind of text contents coming in -- scripture or standard.
#    Handle no analyses in a text.
#
#   Version 1.1 - 9/28/16 - Ron
#    Moved main extraction code from ExtractSourceText here to be shared with 
#    LiveRuleTesterTool.py
#
#   Shared functions
