#
#   Version 3.2.3 - 7/1/21 - Ron Lockwood
#    Fixed bugs with punctuation algorithm. Initialize maps properly. Output the
#    preceding punctuation of a sentence. Moved punctuation_eval() to Utils
#    Put out a space after writing 'after' and 'final' punctuation. 
#    When a sentence doesn't have parsing don't automatically put out a newline.
#    Only do it when it is the last sentence of the paragraph.
#    Omit 'ra' when building punctuation maps.

#    and addInseredWordsList. Bug fix: check if we get None for the sent. object
#    for the number given. Give an error if needed.
#
#   Version 3.0 - 1/26/21 - Ron Lockwood
#    Changes for python 3 conversion
#
#   Version 2.1.4 - 7/29/20 - Ron Lockwood
#    Use an offset when writing punctuation in TreeTran case.
#    
#   Version 2.1.3 - 7/29/20 - Ron Lockwood
#    Write the punctuation of the words in their normal order when doing TreeTran.
#    This avoids punctuation staying with words that change their order.
#    
#   Version 2.1.2 - 3/27/20 - Ron Lockwood
#    Handle adding sentence punctuation when using TreeTran.
#    
#   Version 2.1.1 - 3/26/20 - Ron Lockwood
#    Moved TreeTran-related class and function to the Utils file.
#
#   Version 2.1 - 3/20/20 - Ron Lockwood
#    Use new getInterlinData function and text and sentence objects we get back.
#
#   Version 2.0.4 - 2/12/20 - Ron Lockwood
#    Don't use sentence number as part of the guid map key.
# 
#   Version 2.0.3 - 2/4/20 - Ron Lockwood
#    Only a tuple of two now coming back from get_interlin.
# 
#   Version 2.0.2 - 1/29/20 - Ron Lockwood
#    Write a newline after a sentence that didn't have a parse. Also put out a 
#    warning with the # of unparsed sentences.
# 
#   Version 2.0.1 - 1/22/20 - Ron Lockwood
#    Use a sentence list from the get_interlinear function to use when there is not
#    a parse available from TreeTran. This fixes the problem where a phrasal verb
#    was reducing the word count and causing the non-parsed sentence to be off by
#    one.
# 
#   Version 2.0 - 12/2/19 - Ron Lockwood
#    Bump version number for FlexTools 2.0
#
#   Version 1.7 - 12/2/19 - Ron Lockwood
#    Import FlexProject instead of DBAcess
#
#   Version 1.6 - 5/23/18 - Ron Lockwood
#    Bump the version number.
#
#   Version 1.3.9 - 1/10/18 - Ron Lockwood
#    Moved the split_compounds function into the Utils file for use by
#    other modules.
#
#   Version 1.3.8 - 12/26/17 - Ron
#    Report the name of the extracted text.
#
#   Version 1.3.7 - 5/3/17 - Ron
#    Convert punctuation string to unicode
#
#   Version 1.3.6 - 12/12/16 - Ron
#    Simpler extraction of Scripture text title.
#
#   Version 1.3.5 - 11/9/16 - Ron
#    If a text name is not found, check to see if it matches a scripture section.
#
#   Version 1.3.4 - 9/28/16 - Ron
#    Moved main extraction code into Utils.py to be shared with 
#    LiveRuleTesterTool.py
#
#   Version 1.3.3 - 6/18/16 - Ron
#    Handle variants of senses.
#
#   Version 1.3.2 - 5/9/16 - Ron
#    Make sure bundle.MorphRA is not null. This can happen when a lexical
#    item gets updated in the lexicon and it leaves no lexical entry link there
#    are *** instead. The sense information might still be there.
#
#   Version 1.3.1 - 4/15/16 - Ron
#    No changes to this module.
#
#   Version 1.2.1 - 2/11/16 - Ron
#    Error checking when opening the analyzed text file.
#
#   Version 1.2.0 - 1/28/16 - Ron
#    Punctuation support. Allow the user to specify the punctuation that 
#    indicates the end of a sentence. This punctuation will get marked
#    with the tag <sent>. The user specifies it in the configuration file.
#    Compound word support. Change one lexical unit containing multiple words
#    to multiple lexical units, one for each word. For example: 
#    ^room1.1<n>service1.1<n>number1.1<n>$ ->
#    ^room1.1<n>$^service1.1<n>$^number1.1<n>$ 
#
#   Version 4 - 7/24/15 - Ron
#    Preserve case in words. 
#    Do capitalization of the extracted word. Use the baseline word as a model
#    for how to capitalize it. For the complex form case, save the 1st base-
#    line word for a model of the whole complex form. Removed large commented
#    section of code that was for checking if the whole text had been analyzed.
#
#   Version 3 - 7/16/15 - Ron
#    Handle irregularly inflected forms. Do this by collecting inflection 
#    features when moving through variants to get to a main entry. Output those
#    saved inflection features as tags. 
#    Handle morphology on initial component(s) of complex forms. Save any tags
#    that are present on the initial component(s) and add them to the complex
#    form as morphology.
#
#   Version 2 - 7/4/15 - Ron
#    Dump a possible inflection class present for the root/stem.
#    Changed module description.

"""
This module will use the Source Text Name set in the Settings. It will first check 
to see if each word in the selected text is
fully analyzed (word gloss or category is not necessary). If the text is not
fully analyzed you will get a warning.
Next, this module will go through each bundle in the interlinear text and export
information in the format that Apertium needs. The general idea is that
affixes and clitics will be exported as <gloss> and root/stems will be exported
as head_word<pos><feat1>...<featN><class1>...<classN>. Where feat1 to featN are one or more 
inflection features that may be present for the root/stem 
and class1 to classN are inflection classes that may be present on the stem.
